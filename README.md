# VitaVehicle - "Realistic" Car Physics (g-rcp2/RCP4)
# ![Screenshot_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88580430/201989925-6646ae2a-5a76-429f-bc60-427b23efe5b1.png) (Beta)

# About
This is a raycast-based car simulator that simulates slip algorithm. This is the second iteration of g-rcp, and it's the fourth generation of my own vehicle dynamics since 2017, as well as the usage of the Blender game engine. This was also ported from BGE despite that it isn't even published for that software yet.

# Help
Help can be found in the VitaVehicle Interface once you've opened the project file via Godot editor.

# Tip
This project isn't novice-friendly.
